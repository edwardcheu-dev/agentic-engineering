# KB — Start Here

This is the recommended path through the KB once it exists.

## The intended flow
1) Understand the competency system:
   - [Competency Map](../competency/COMPETENCY_MAP.md)
   - [Traceability Matrix](../competency/TRACEABILITY.md)

2) Navigate the KB via Competency IDs:
   - Every artifact is stored in: `docs/kb/<DOMAIN>/<COMPETENCY_ID>/`
   - Use the [KB Index](index.md) to browse active domains.

3) Learn the control-plane workflow:
   - (TBD) playbook: Session bootstrap + verify + distill

4) Learn the product loop:
   - [Product Registry](../products/README.md)
   - product overview(s) under docs/products/<product>/

## Current status
The KB is being bootstrapped.
The immediate goal is to add the first 1–2 playbooks and wire them into TRACEABILITY.
