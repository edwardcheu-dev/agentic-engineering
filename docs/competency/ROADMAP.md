# Competency Roadmap (iterative, not time-based)

This file is optional: it’s a prioritized “next deltas” list.
It is not a schedule.

## Default prioritization
1) Control plane health (ACW / EVAL / OPS / SEC) so iteration stays reliable
2) Traceability coverage (fill TRACEABILITY for what already exists)
3) The next product increment that exercises missing competencies
4) Distill into KB so knowledge becomes transferable

## Next small deltas (seed list)
- Standardize ACW-01/02/04 via a single KB playbook + macro usage
- Create first KB index spine (docs/kb/index.md + START_HERE flow)
- Choose Product 1 (Harness) scope and define which competencies it must exercise
