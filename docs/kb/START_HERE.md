# KB — Start Here

This is the recommended path through the KB once it exists.

## The intended flow
1) Understand the competency system:
   - docs/competency/COMPETENCY_MAP.md
   - docs/competency/TRACEABILITY.md

2) Learn the control-plane workflow:
   - (TBD) playbook: Session bootstrap + verify + distill

3) Learn the product loop:
   - docs/products/README.md
   - product overview(s) under docs/products/<product>/

## Current status
The KB is being bootstrapped.
The immediate goal is to add the first 1–2 playbooks and wire them into TRACEABILITY.
