# Weekly Notes (docs/weeks/)

This is the raw input layer: what happened, what was tried, what broke, what worked.

Rule of thumb:
- If it’s still true in 6 months → distill into docs/kb/
- If it’s a decision → write an ADR in docs/decisions/
- If it’s a diary of experiments → keep it here

Folder convention:
- `docs/weeks/YYYY-Www/` (ISO week; gaps allowed)
