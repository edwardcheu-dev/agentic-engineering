# Score Competencies (0–3)

Inputs:
- docs/competency/COMPETENCY_MAP.md
- docs/competency/SCORECARD.md
- docs/competency/TRACEABILITY.md
- recent PR diffs (or summary)

Output:
1) Proposed SCORECARD updates (conservative)
2) Gaps in TRACEABILITY (missing KB / evidence / product usage)
3) Next 3 smallest deltas to improve scores or coverage

Do not modify `COMPETENCY_MAP.md` except to fix obvious typos; treat it as canonical. Only update SCORECARD/TRACEABILITY/KB and link to evidence.
