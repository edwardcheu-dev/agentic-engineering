# AGENT_CONTEXT — agentic-engineering

This repository is a long-lived public “Learning Factory” for production LLM + agentic systems.

## North Star
Master an agentic coding workflow and build production-grade LLM/agentic applications with:
- strong evaluation + reliability practices
- explicit traceability from learning targets → evidence → distilled knowledge

## The 3 pillars (control plane)
1) **Competency Map (North Star):** `docs/competency/`
2) **Products (Vehicles):** `docs/products/`
3) **Knowledge Base (Blueprint):** `docs/kb/` (most important)

Supporting layers:
- ADRs: `docs/decisions/`
- Weekly raw notes: `docs/weeks/`

## Definition of “learned” (non-negotiable)
For any meaningful work/PR:
- It must cite **competency IDs**
- It must add/update **evidence** (code/tests/evals/docs/ADRs)
- It must add/update **distillation** (KB artifact)

If it doesn’t have evidence + distillation, it’s not “learned,” it was “experienced once.”

## Always-load files (when working in this repo)
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/competency/COMPETENCY_MAP.md`
- `docs/competency/SCORECARD.md`
- `docs/competency/TRACEABILITY.md`
- `docs/products/README.md`
- `docs/kb/index.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `README.md`
- `LEARNING_LOG.md`

## Public repo safety
- Treat this repo as public forever.
- No secrets in git history, logs, docs, or examples.
