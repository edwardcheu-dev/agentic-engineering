# Learning Factory Roadmap — agentic-engineering

The repo is a **Learning Factory** with 3 pillars and explicit traceability:

1) Competency Map: `docs/competency/`
2) Products: `docs/products/`
3) Knowledge Base: `docs/kb/`

Start here:
- `docs/competency/COMPETENCY_MAP.md`
- `docs/competency/TRACEABILITY.md`
- `docs/competency/ROADMAP.md` (optional next-focus list; iterative)

## What “done” means
A competency is “done” only when it has:
- **Evidence** (code/tests/evals/docs/ADRs), AND
- **Distillation** (KB artifact),
- plus product usage coverage in traceability.

See:
- `docs/competency/TRACEABILITY.md`
