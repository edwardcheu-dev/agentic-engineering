# Knowledge Base (docs/kb/)

The KB is the repo’s **blueprint layer**: distilled knowledge that should still be true in 6 months.

## What belongs here
- Playbooks (step-by-step recipes + checklists)
- Patterns (reusable architectures/design patterns)
- Templates (ADR, eval spec, runbook, prompt template)
- Reference implementations/snippets (minimal, reusable)
- Glossaries (shared definitions: MCP/A2A/MAS/context engineering)
- Risks/threat models/failure taxonomies

## What does NOT belong here
- Raw session notes (those belong in docs/weeks/)
- One-off experiments without a generalized takeaway

## How KB proves progress
A KB page should reference:
- which competency IDs it supports
- the evidence (tests/evals/PRs) that back it up
- optionally, which products used it
